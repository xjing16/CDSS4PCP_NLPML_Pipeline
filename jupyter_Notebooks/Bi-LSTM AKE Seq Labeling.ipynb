      "--------------------\n",
      "Management of the complex chronically ill patient is highly problematic. This is due to the need to complement recommendations in clinical guidelines with recommendations based on treatments performed on a representative set of patients. It is necessary to identify conflicts between the recommendations of different guidelines designed for handling specific chronic diseases. The PITeS-TIiSS project (code PI15/01213) aims to overcome this problem by designing and deploying an ontology-based personalized clinical decision support tool. This helps to improve personalized decisions and reduces variability in clinical practice in an integrated care environment. This paper describes the methodology followed in developing the ontology used to infer clinical knowledge and to develop and implement the support tool. The tool will access the information provided by the Electronic Health Record of Andalusian Health Public Service, the main healthcare provider in a region in Spain with more than eight million inhabitants.\n",

      "A mobile health monitoring-and-treatment system based on integration of the SSN sensor ontology and the HL7 FHIR standard.\n",
      "--------------------\n",
      "BACKGROUND\n",
      "Mobile health (MH) technologies including clinical decision support systems (CDSS) provide an efficient method for patient monitoring and treatment. A mobile CDSS is based on real-time sensor data and historical electronic health record (EHR) data. Raw sensor data have no semantics of their own; therefore, a computer system cannot interpret these data automatically. In addition, the interoperability of sensor data and EHR medical data is a challenge. EHR data collected from distributed systems have different structures, semantics, and coding mechanisms. As a result, building a transparent CDSS that can work as a portable plug-and-play component in any existing EHR ecosystem requires a careful design process. Ontology and medical standards support the construction of semantically intelligent CDSSs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "METHODS\n",
      "This paper proposes a comprehensive MH framework with an integrated CDSS capability. This cloud-based system monitors and manages type 1 diabetes mellitus. The efficiency of any CDSS depends mainly on the quality of its knowledge and its semantic interoperability with different data sources. To this end, this paper concentrates on constructing a semantic CDSS based on proposed FASTO ontology.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "RESULTS\n",
      "This realistic ontology is able to collect, formalize, integrate, analyze, and manipulate all types of patient data. It provides patients with complete, personalized, and medically intuitive care plans, including insulin regimens, diets, exercises, and education sub-plans. These plans are based on the complete patient profile. In addition, the proposed CDSS provides real-time patient monitoring based on vital signs collected from patients' wireless body area networks. These monitoring include real-time insulin adjustments, mealtime carbohydrate calculations, and exercise recommendations. FASTO integrates the well-known standards of HL7 fast healthcare interoperability resources (FHIR), semantic sensor network (SSN) ontology, basic formal ontology (BFO) 2.0, and clinical practice guidelines. The current version of FASTO includes 9577 classes, 658 object properties, 164 data properties, 460 individuals, and 140 SWRL rules. FASTO is publicly available through the National Center for Biomedical Ontology BioPortal at https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/FASTO .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS\n",
      "The resulting CDSS system can help physicians to monitor more patients efficiently and accurately. In addition, patients in rural areas can depend on the system to manage their diabetes and emergencies.\n",

      "Clinical decision support system for point of care use--ontology-driven design and software implementation.\n",
      "--------------------\n",
      "OBJECTIVES\n",
      "The objective of this research was to design a clinical decision support system (CDSS) that supports heterogeneous clinical decision problems and runs on multiple computing platforms. Meeting this objective required a novel design to create an extendable and easy to maintain clinical CDSS for point of care support. The proposed solution was evaluated in a proof of concept implementation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "METHODS\n",
      "Based on our earlier research with the design of a mobile CDSS for emergency triage we used ontology-driven design to represent essential components of a CDSS. Models of clinical decision problems were derived from the ontology and they were processed into executable applications during runtime. This allowed scaling applications' functionality to the capabilities of computing platforms. A prototype of the system was implemented using the extended client-server architecture and Web services to distribute the functions of the system and to make it operational in limited connectivity conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "RESULTS\n",
      "The proposed design provided a common framework that facilitated development of diversified clinical applications running seamlessly on a variety of computing platforms. It was prototyped for two clinical decision problems and settings (triage of acute pain in the emergency department and postoperative management of radical prostatectomy on the hospital ward) and implemented on two computing platforms--desktop and handheld computers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS\n",
      "The requirement of the CDSS heterogeneity was satisfied with ontology-driven design. Processing of application models described with the help of ontological models allowed having a complex system running on multiple computing platforms with different capabilities. Finally, separation of models and runtime components contributed to improved extensibility and maintainability of the system.\n",

      "An Ontology-Based Personalized Decision Support System for Use in the Complex Chronically Ill Patient.\n",
      "--------------------\n",
      "Management of the complex chronically ill patient is highly problematic. This is due to the need to complement recommendations in clinical guidelines with recommendations based on treatments performed on a representative set of patients. It is necessary to identify conflicts between the recommendations of different guidelines designed for handling specific chronic diseases. The PITeS-TIiSS project (code PI15/01213) aims to overcome this problem by designing and deploying an ontology-based personalized clinical decision support tool. This helps to improve personalized decisions and reduces variability in clinical practice in an integrated care environment. This paper describes the methodology followed in developing the ontology used to infer clinical knowledge and to develop and implement the support tool. The tool will access the information provided by the Electronic Health Record of Andalusian Health Public Service, the main healthcare provider in a region in Spain with more than eight million inhabitants.\n",

      "--------------------\n",
      "BACKGROUND\n",
      "Mobile health (MH) technologies including clinical decision support systems (CDSS) provide an efficient method for patient monitoring and treatment. A mobile CDSS is based on real-time sensor data and historical electronic health record (EHR) data. Raw sensor data have no semantics of their own; therefore, a computer system cannot interpret these data automatically. In addition, the interoperability of sensor data and EHR medical data is a challenge. EHR data collected from distributed systems have different structures, semantics, and coding mechanisms. As a result, building a transparent CDSS that can work as a portable plug-and-play component in any existing EHR ecosystem requires a careful design process. Ontology and medical standards support the construction of semantically intelligent CDSSs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "METHODS\n",
      "This paper proposes a comprehensive MH framework with an integrated CDSS capability. This cloud-based system monitors and manages type 1 diabetes mellitus. The efficiency of any CDSS depends mainly on the quality of its knowledge and its semantic interoperability with different data sources. To this end, this paper concentrates on constructing a semantic CDSS based on proposed FASTO ontology.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "RESULTS\n",
      "This realistic ontology is able to collect, formalize, integrate, analyze, and manipulate all types of patient data. It provides patients with complete, personalized, and medically intuitive care plans, including insulin regimens, diets, exercises, and education sub-plans. These plans are based on the complete patient profile. In addition, the proposed CDSS provides real-time patient monitoring based on vital signs collected from patients' wireless body area networks. These monitoring include real-time insulin adjustments, mealtime carbohydrate calculations, and exercise recommendations. FASTO integrates the well-known standards of HL7 fast healthcare interoperability resources (FHIR), semantic sensor network (SSN) ontology, basic formal ontology (BFO) 2.0, and clinical practice guidelines. The current version of FASTO includes 9577 classes, 658 object properties, 164 data properties, 460 individuals, and 140 SWRL rules. FASTO is publicly available through the National Center for Biomedical Ontology BioPortal at https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/FASTO .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS\n",
      "The resulting CDSS system can help physicians to monitor more patients efficiently and accurately. In addition, patients in rural areas can depend on the system to manage their diabetes and emergencies.\n",

      "--------------------\n",
      "OBJECTIVES\n",
      "The objective of this research was to design a clinical decision support system (CDSS) that supports heterogeneous clinical decision problems and runs on multiple computing platforms. Meeting this objective required a novel design to create an extendable and easy to maintain clinical CDSS for point of care support. The proposed solution was evaluated in a proof of concept implementation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "METHODS\n",
      "Based on our earlier research with the design of a mobile CDSS for emergency triage we used ontology-driven design to represent essential components of a CDSS. Models of clinical decision problems were derived from the ontology and they were processed into executable applications during runtime. This allowed scaling applications' functionality to the capabilities of computing platforms. A prototype of the system was implemented using the extended client-server architecture and Web services to distribute the functions of the system and to make it operational in limited connectivity conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "RESULTS\n",
      "The proposed design provided a common framework that facilitated development of diversified clinical applications running seamlessly on a variety of computing platforms. It was prototyped for two clinical decision problems and settings (triage of acute pain in the emergency department and postoperative management of radical prostatectomy on the hospital ward) and implemented on two computing platforms--desktop and handheld computers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS\n",
      "The requirement of the CDSS heterogeneity was satisfied with ontology-driven design. Processing of application models described with the help of ontological models allowed having a complex system running on multiple computing platforms with different capabilities. Finally, separation of models and runtime components contributed to improved extensibility and maintainability of the system.\n",

      "existing computer-based ordering systems for physicians provide effective drug-centered checks but offer little assistance for optimizing the overall patient-centered treatment strategy. evidence-based clinical practice guidelines have been developed to disseminate state-of-the-art information concerning treatment strategy but these guidelines are poorly used in routine practice. the asti project aims to design a guideline-based ordering system to enable general practitioners to avoid prescription errors and to improve compliance with best therapeutic practices. the \" critic mode \" operates as a background process and corrects the physician's prescription on the basis of automatically triggered elementary rules that account for isolated guideline recommendations. the \" guided mode \" directs the physician to the best treatment by browsing a comprehensive guideline knowledge base represented as a decision tree. a first prototype, applied to hypertension, is currently under development.\n",

      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "recently, studies have shown the benefits of using clinical guidelines in the practice of medicine. there have been numerous efforts to develop clinical decision support systems that support guideline-based care in an automated fashion, covering a wide range of clinical settings and tasks. despite these efforts, only a few systems progressed beyond the prototype stage and the research laboratory. for guideline-based clinical decision support systems to be successful, a balance must be made between intuitive but imprecise representations usually encountered by most of today's systems and representations that support a strong underlying clinical performance model. the project described in this paper tries to achieve such a balance. it presents the gaston architecture that contains a set of reusable software components for the application of guidelines, including design-time components to facilitate the guideline authoring process based on guideline representation models along with execution-time components for building decision support systems that incorporate these guidelines. this architecture was used to develop several guideline representation models such as a rule-based representation to model rule-based guidelines and guideline representation models that address more complex tasks. also, decision support systems that incorporate these models were developed with the architecture. for the representation and application of various classes of guidelines, rules were also viewed as instances of more complex tasks. by identifying similar characteristics of sets of rules, we developed several tasks such as a drug intera ction and drug contraindication task. based on these models, we have developed and validated guidelines and decision support systems for use in several application domains such as intensive care, family physicians and psychiatry. in order to be able to represent more complex time-oriented plans, new guideline representation models are being developed.\n",

      "in healthcare organizations, clinical workflows are executed by interdisciplinary healthcare teams (ihts) that operate in ways that are difficult to manage. responding to a need to support such teams, we designed and developed the met4 multi-agent system that allows ihts to manage patients according to presentation-specific clinical workflows. in this paper, we describe a significant extension of the met4 system that allows for supporting rich team dynamics (understood as team formation, management and task-practitioner allocation), including selection and maintenance of the most responsible physician and more complex rules of selecting practitioners for the workflow tasks. in order to develop this extension, we introduced three semantic components: (1) a revised ontology describing concepts and relations pertinent to ihts, workflows, and managed patients, (2) a set of behavioral rules describing the team dynamics, and (3) an instance base that stores facts corresponding to instances of concepts from the ontology and to relations between these instances. the semantic components are represented in first-order logic and they can be automatically processed using theorem proving and model finding techniques. we employ these techniques to find models that correspond to specific decisions controlling the dynamics of iht. in the paper, we present the design of extended met4 with a special focus on the new semantic components. we then describe its proof-of-concept implementation using the wade multi-agent platform and the z3 solver (theorem prover/model finder). we illustrate the main ideas discussed in the paper with a clinical scenario of an iht managing a patient with chronic kidney disease.\n",

      "the primary aim of this work was the development of a uniform, contextualized and sustainable knowledge-based framework to support adverse drug event (ade) prevention via clinical decision support systems (cdsss). in this regard, the employed methodology involved first the systematic analysis and formalization of the knowledge sources elaborated in the scope of this work, through which an application-specific knowledge model has been defined. the entire framework architecture has been then specified and implemented by adopting computer interpretable guidelines (cigs) as the knowledge engineering formalism for its construction. the framework integrates diverse and dynamic knowledge sources in the form of rule-based ade signals, all under a uniform knowledge base (kb) structure, according to the defined knowledge model. equally important, it employs the means to contextualize the encapsulated knowledge, in order to provide appropriate support considering the specific local environment (hospital, medical department, language, etc.), as well as the mechanisms for knowledge querying, inference, sharing, and management. in this paper, we present thoroughly the establishment of the proposed knowledge framework by presenting the employed methodology and the results obtained as regards implementation, performance and validation aspects that highlight its applicability and virtue in medication safety.\n",

      "surgical training improves patient care, helps to reduce surgical risks, increases surgeon's confidence, and thus enhances overall patient safety. current surgical training systems are more focused on developing technical skills, e.g. dexterity, of the surgeons while lacking the aspects of context-awareness and intra-operative real-time guidance. context-aware intelligent training systems interpret the current surgical situation and help surgeons to train on surgical tasks. as a prototypical scenario, we chose thoracentesis procedure in this work. we designed the context-aware software framework using the surgical process model encompassing ontology and production rules, based on the procedure descriptions obtained through textbooks and interviews, and ontology-based and marker-based object recognition, where the system tracked and recognised surgical instruments and materials in surgeon's hands and recognised surgical instruments on the surgical stand. the ontology was validated using annotated surgical videos, where the system identified \"anaesthesia\" and \"aspiration\" phase with 100% relative frequency and \"penetration\" phase with 65% relative frequency. the system tracked surgical swab and 50ml syringe with approximately 88.23% and 100% accuracy in surgeon's hands and recognised surgical instruments with approximately 90% accuracy on the surgical stand. surgical workflow training with the proposed system showed equivalent results as the traditional mentor-based training regime, thus this work is a step forward a new tool for context awareness and decision-making during surgical training.\n",

      "patients with multiple medical conditions (comorbidity) pose major challenges to clinical decision support systems, since the different clinical practice guidelines (cpg) often involve adverse interactions, such as drug-drug or drug-disease interactions. moreover, opportunities often exist for optimizing care and resources across multiple cpg. these challenges have been taken up in the state of the art, with many approaches focusing on the static integration of comorbid cig. nevertheless, we observe that many aspects often change dynamically over time, in ways that cannot be foreseen - such as delays in care tasks, resource availability, test outcomes, and acute comorbid conditions. to ensure the clinical safety and effectiveness of integrating multiple comorbid cig, these execution-time difficulties must be considered. further, when dealing with comorbid conditions, we remark that clinical practitioners typically consider multiple complex solutions, depending on the patient's health profile. hence, execution-time flexibility, based on dynamic health parameters, is needed to effectively and safely cope with comorbid conditions. in this work, we introduce a flexible, knowledge-driven and execution-time approach to comorbid cig integration, based on an owl ontology with clearly defined integration semantics.\n",

      "chronically ill patients are complex health care cases that require the coordinated interaction of multiple professionals. a correct intervention of these sort of patients entails the accurate analysis of the conditions of each concrete patient and the adaptation of evidence-based standard intervention plans to these conditions. there are some other clinical circumstances such as wrong diagnoses, unobserved comorbidities, missing information, unobserved related diseases or prevention, whose detection depends on the capacities of deduction of the professionals involved. in this paper, we introduce an ontology for the care of chronically ill patients and implement two personalization processes and a decision support tool. the first personalization process adapts the contents of the ontology to the particularities observed in the health-care record of a given concrete patient, automatically providing a personalized ontology containing only the clinical information that is relevant for health-care professionals to manage that patient. the second personalization process uses the personalized ontology of a patient to automatically transform intervention plans describing health-care general treatments into individual intervention plans. for comorbid patients, this process concludes with the semi-automatic integration of several individual plans into a single personalized plan. finally, the ontology is also used as the knowledge base of a decision support tool that helps health-care professionals to detect anomalous circumstances such as wrong diagnoses, unobserved comorbidities, missing information, unobserved related diseases, or preventive actions. seven health-care centers participating in the k4care project, together with the group sagesa and the local health system in the town of pollenza have served as the validation platform for these two processes and tool. health-care professionals participating in the evaluation agree about the average quality 84% (5.9/7.0) and utility 90% (6.3/7.0) of the tools and also about the correct reasoning of the decision support tool, according to clinical standards.\n",

      "recently, healthcare services can be delivered effectively to patients anytime and anywhere using e-health systems. e-health systems are developed through information and communication technologies (ict) that involve sensors, mobiles, and web-based applications for the delivery of healthcare services and information. remote healthcare is an important purpose of the e-health system. usually, the ehealth system includes heterogeneous sensors from diverse manufacturers producing data in different formats. device interoperability and data normalization is a challenging task that needs research attention. several solutions are proposed in the literature based on manual interpretation through explicit programming. however, programmatically implementing the interpretation of the data sender and data receiver in the e-health system for the data transmission is counterproductive as modification will be required for each new device added into the system. in this paper, an e-health system with the semantic sensor network (ssn) is proposed to address the device interoperability issue. in the proposed system, we have used ietf yang for modeling the semantic e-health data to represent the information of e-health sensors. this modeling scheme helps in provisioning semantic interoperability between devices and expressing the sensing data in a user-friendly manner. for this purpose, we have developed an ontology for e-health data that supports different styles of data formats. the ontology is defined in yang for provisioning semantic interpretation of sensing data in the system by constructing meta-models of e-health sensors. the proposed approach assists in the auto-configuration of ehealth sensors and querying the sensor network with semantic interoperability support for the e-health system.\n",

      "the available antibiotic decision-making systems were developed from a physician's perspective. however, because infectious diseases are common, many patients desire access to knowledge via a search engine. although the use of antibiotics should, in principle, be subject to a doctor's advice, many patients take them without authorization, and some people cannot easily or rapidly consult a doctor. in such cases, a reliable antibiotic prescription support system is needed.\n",

      "methods and results\n",
      "this study describes the construction and optimization of the sensitivity and specificity of a decision support system named iddap, which is based on ontologies for infectious disease diagnosis and antibiotic therapy. the ontology for this system was constructed by collecting existing ontologies associated with infectious diseases, syndromes, bacteria and drugs into the ontology's hierarchical conceptual schema. first, iddap identifies a potential infectious disease based on a patient's self-described disease state. then, the system searches for and proposes an appropriate antibiotic therapy specifically adapted to the patient based on factors such as the patient's body temperature, infection sites, symptoms/signs, complications, antibacterial spectrum, contraindications, drug-drug interactions between the proposed therapy and previously prescribed medication, and the route of therapy administration. the constructed domain ontology contains 1,267,004 classes, 7,608,725 axioms, and 1,266,993 members of \"subclassof\" that pertain to infectious diseases, bacteria, syndromes, anti-bacterial drugs and other relevant components. the system includes 507 infectious diseases and their therapy methods in combination with 332 different infection sites, 936 relevant symptoms of the digestive, reproductive, neurological and other systems, 371 types of complications, 838,407 types of bacteria, 341 types of antibiotics, 1504 pairs of reaction rates (antibacterial spectrum) between antibiotics and bacteria, 431 pairs of drug interaction relationships and 86 pairs of antibiotic-specific population contraindicated relationships. compared with the existing infectious disease-relevant ontologies in the field of knowledge comprehension, this ontology is more complete. analysis of iddap's performance in terms of classifiers based on receiver operating characteristic (roc) curve results (89.91%) revealed iddap's advantages when combined with our ontology.\n",

      "the arden syntax was introduced more than 10 years ago, but it is still not in widespread use. one reason might be that for each particular architecture and information system, a different arden syntax compiler must be written as well as a program for the runtime execution of the medical logic modules (mlms). the authors have designed and implemented an architecture that increases the portability of arden syntax rules, using the java platform. the portability to a target information system is achieved by the addition of appropriate adapter components, which they call mappers. these mappers are dynamically selected using explicit and implicit elements of mlms. furthermore, they can help translate data from the clinical information system representation into the representation needed by an mlm. this was validated by an experiment in two clinical units. also, the authors propose a convention to name signals that trigger other mlms (called intermediate states) so that they remain unique to each institution. the authors implemented this architecture in their clinical system and in an xml-based medical record application that has been used experimentally in their urology and nephrology departments. the tetrasys company that provided the medical record was able to incorporate their runtime without modifications, and typical mlm execution time was less than 1 sec.\n",

      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "in this paper, sams, a novel health information system architecture for developing intelligent health information systems is proposed and also some strategies for developing such systems are discussed. the systems fulfilling this architecture will be able to store electronic health records of the patients using owl ontologies, share patient records among different hospitals and provide physicians expertise to assist them in making decisions. the system is intelligent because it is rule-based, makes use of rule-based reasoning and has the ability to learn and evolve itself. the learning capability is provided by extracting rules from previously given decisions by the physicians and then adding the extracted rules to the system. the proposed system is novel and original in all of these aspects. as a case study, a system is implemented conforming to sams architecture for use by dentists in the dental domain. the use of the developed system is described with a scenario. for evaluation, the developed dental information system will be used and tried by a group of dentists. the development of this system proves the applicability of sams architecture. by getting decision support from a system derived from this architecture, the cognitive gap between experienced and inexperienced physicians can be compensated. thus, patient satisfaction can be achieved, inexperienced physicians are supported in decision making and the personnel can improve their knowledge. a physician can diagnose a case, which he/she has never diagnosed before, using this system. with the help of this system, it will be possible to store general domain knowledge in this system and the personnel's need to medical guideline documents will be reduced.\n",

      "clinical management of comorbidities is a challenge, especially in a clinical decision support setting, as it requires the safe and efficient reconciliation of multiple disease-specific clinical procedures to formulate a comorbid therapeutic plan that is both effective and safe for the patient. in this paper we pursue the integration of multiple disease-specific clinical practice guidelines (cpg) in order to manage co-morbidities within a computerized clinical decision support system (cdss). we present a cpg integration framework-termed as comet (comorbidity ontological modeling & execution) that manifests a knowledge management approach to model, computerize and integrate multiple cpg to yield a comorbid cpg knowledge model that upon execution can provide evidence-based recommendations for handling comorbid patients. comet exploits semantic web technologies to achieve (a) cpg knowledge synthesis to translate a paper-based cpg to disease-specific clinical pathways (cp) that include specialized co-morbidity management procedures based on input from domain experts; (b) cpg knowledge modeling to computerize the disease-specific cp using a comorbidity cpg ontology; (c) cpg knowledge integration by aligning multiple ontologically-modeled cp to develop a unified comorbid cpg knowledge model; and (e) cpg knowledge execution using reasoning engines to derive cpg-mediated recommendations for managing patients with comorbidities. we present a web-accessible comet cdss that provides family physicians with cpg-mediated comorbidity decision support to manage atrial fibrillation and chronic heart failure. we present our qualitative and quantitative analysis of the knowledge content and usability of comet cdss.\n",

      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "recently, studies have shown the benefits of using clinical guidelines in the practice of medicine. there have been numerous efforts to develop clinical decision support systems that support guideline-based care in an automated fashion, covering a wide range of clinical settings and tasks. despite these efforts, only a few systems progressed beyond the prototype stage and the research laboratory. for guideline-based clinical decision support systems to be successful, a balance must be made between intuitive but imprecise representations usually encountered by most of today's systems and representations that support a strong underlying clinical performance model. the project described in this paper tries to achieve such a balance. it presents the gaston architecture that contains a set of reusable software components for the application of guidelines, including design-time components to facilitate the guideline authoring process based on guideline representation models along with execution-time components for building decision support systems that incorporate these guidelines. this architecture was used to develop several guideline representation models such as a rule-based representation to model rule-based guidelines and guideline representation models that address more complex tasks. also, decision support systems that incorporate these models were developed with the architecture. for the representation and application of various classes of guidelines, rules were also viewed as instances of more complex tasks. by identifying similar characteristics of sets of rules, we developed several tasks such as a drug intera ction and drug contraindication task. based on these models, we have developed and validated guidelines and decision support systems for use in several application domains such as intensive care, family physicians and psychiatry. in order to be able to represent more complex time-oriented plans, new guideline representation models are being developed.\n",

      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "an increasing number of decision support systems based on domain knowledge are adopted to diagnose medical conditions such as diabetes and heart disease. it is widely pointed that the classical ontologies cannot sufficiently handle imprecise and vague knowledge for some real world applications, but fuzzy ontology can effectively resolve data and knowledge problems with uncertainty. this paper presents a novel fuzzy expert system for diabetes decision support application. a five-layer fuzzy ontology, including a fuzzy knowledge layer, fuzzy group relation layer, fuzzy group domain layer, fuzzy personal relation layer, and fuzzy personal domain layer, is developed in the fuzzy expert system to describe knowledge with uncertainty. by applying the novel fuzzy ontology to the diabetes domain, the structure of the fuzzy diabetes ontology (fdo) is defined to model the diabetes knowledge. additionally, a semantic decision support agent (sdsa), including a knowledge construction mechanism, fuzzy ontology generating mechanism, and semantic fuzzy decision making mechanism, is also developed. the knowledge construction mechanism constructs the fuzzy concepts and relations based on the structure of the fdo. the instances of the fdo are generated by the fuzzy ontology generating mechanism. finally, based on the fdo and the fuzzy ontology, the semantic fuzzy decision making mechanism simulates the semantic description of medical staff for diabetes-related application. importantly, the proposed fuzzy expert system can work effectively for diabetes decision support application.\n",

      "the primary aim of this work was the development of a uniform, contextualized and sustainable knowledge-based framework to support adverse drug event (ade) prevention via clinical decision support systems (cdsss). in this regard, the employed methodology involved first the systematic analysis and formalization of the knowledge sources elaborated in the scope of this work, through which an application-specific knowledge model has been defined. the entire framework architecture has been then specified and implemented by adopting computer interpretable guidelines (cigs) as the knowledge engineering formalism for its construction. the framework integrates diverse and dynamic knowledge sources in the form of rule-based ade signals, all under a uniform knowledge base (kb) structure, according to the defined knowledge model. equally important, it employs the means to contextualize the encapsulated knowledge, in order to provide appropriate support considering the specific local environment (hospital, medical department, language, etc.), as well as the mechanisms for knowledge querying, inference, sharing, and management. in this paper, we present thoroughly the establishment of the proposed knowledge framework by presenting the employed methodology and the results obtained as regards implementation, performance and validation aspects that highlight its applicability and virtue in medication safety.\n",

      "surgical training improves patient care, helps to reduce surgical risks, increases surgeon's confidence, and thus enhances overall patient safety. current surgical training systems are more focused on developing technical skills, e.g. dexterity, of the surgeons while lacking the aspects of context-awareness and intra-operative real-time guidance. context-aware intelligent training systems interpret the current surgical situation and help surgeons to train on surgical tasks. as a prototypical scenario, we chose thoracentesis procedure in this work. we designed the context-aware software framework using the surgical process model encompassing ontology and production rules, based on the procedure descriptions obtained through textbooks and interviews, and ontology-based and marker-based object recognition, where the system tracked and recognised surgical instruments and materials in surgeon's hands and recognised surgical instruments on the surgical stand. the ontology was validated using annotated surgical videos, where the system identified \"anaesthesia\" and \"aspiration\" phase with 100% relative frequency and \"penetration\" phase with 65% relative frequency. the system tracked surgical swab and 50ml syringe with approximately 88.23% and 100% accuracy in surgeon's hands and recognised surgical instruments with approximately 90% accuracy on the surgical stand. surgical workflow training with the proposed system showed equivalent results as the traditional mentor-based training regime, thus this work is a step forward a new tool for context awareness and decision-making during surgical training.\n",

      "recently, healthcare services can be delivered effectively to patients anytime and anywhere using e-health systems. e-health systems are developed through information and communication technologies (ict) that involve sensors, mobiles, and web-based applications for the delivery of healthcare services and information. remote healthcare is an important purpose of the e-health system. usually, the ehealth system includes heterogeneous sensors from diverse manufacturers producing data in different formats. device interoperability and data normalization is a challenging task that needs research attention. several solutions are proposed in the literature based on manual interpretation through explicit programming. however, programmatically implementing the interpretation of the data sender and data receiver in the e-health system for the data transmission is counterproductive as modification will be required for each new device added into the system. in this paper, an e-health system with the semantic sensor network (ssn) is proposed to address the device interoperability issue. in the proposed system, we have used ietf yang for modeling the semantic e-health data to represent the information of e-health sensors. this modeling scheme helps in provisioning semantic interoperability between devices and expressing the sensing data in a user-friendly manner. for this purpose, we have developed an ontology for e-health data that supports different styles of data formats. the ontology is defined in yang for provisioning semantic interpretation of sensing data in the system by constructing meta-models of e-health sensors. the proposed approach assists in the auto-configuration of ehealth sensors and querying the sensor network with semantic interoperability support for the e-health system.\n",

      "the available antibiotic decision-making systems were developed from a physician's perspective. however, because infectious diseases are common, many patients desire access to knowledge via a search engine. although the use of antibiotics should, in principle, be subject to a doctor's advice, many patients take them without authorization, and some people cannot easily or rapidly consult a doctor. in such cases, a reliable antibiotic prescription support system is needed.\n",

      "methods and results\n",
      "this study describes the construction and optimization of the sensitivity and specificity of a decision support system named iddap, which is based on ontologies for infectious disease diagnosis and antibiotic therapy. the ontology for this system was constructed by collecting existing ontologies associated with infectious diseases, syndromes, bacteria and drugs into the ontology's hierarchical conceptual schema. first, iddap identifies a potential infectious disease based on a patient's self-described disease state. then, the system searches for and proposes an appropriate antibiotic therapy specifically adapted to the patient based on factors such as the patient's body temperature, infection sites, symptoms/signs, complications, antibacterial spectrum, contraindications, drug-drug interactions between the proposed therapy and previously prescribed medication, and the route of therapy administration. the constructed domain ontology contains 1,267,004 classes, 7,608,725 axioms, and 1,266,993 members of \"subclassof\" that pertain to infectious diseases, bacteria, syndromes, anti-bacterial drugs and other relevant components. the system includes 507 infectious diseases and their therapy methods in combination with 332 different infection sites, 936 relevant symptoms of the digestive, reproductive, neurological and other systems, 371 types of complications, 838,407 types of bacteria, 341 types of antibiotics, 1504 pairs of reaction rates (antibacterial spectrum) between antibiotics and bacteria, 431 pairs of drug interaction relationships and 86 pairs of antibiotic-specific population contraindicated relationships. compared with the existing infectious disease-relevant ontologies in the field of knowledge comprehension, this ontology is more complete. analysis of iddap's performance in terms of classifiers based on receiver operating characteristic (roc) curve results (89.91%) revealed iddap's advantages when combined with our ontology.\n",

      "the arden syntax was introduced more than 10 years ago, but it is still not in widespread use. one reason might be that for each particular architecture and information system, a different arden syntax compiler must be written as well as a program for the runtime execution of the medical logic modules (mlms). the authors have designed and implemented an architecture that increases the portability of arden syntax rules, using the java platform. the portability to a target information system is achieved by the addition of appropriate adapter components, which they call mappers. these mappers are dynamically selected using explicit and implicit elements of mlms. furthermore, they can help translate data from the clinical information system representation into the representation needed by an mlm. this was validated by an experiment in two clinical units. also, the authors propose a convention to name signals that trigger other mlms (called intermediate states) so that they remain unique to each institution. the authors implemented this architecture in their clinical system and in an xml-based medical record application that has been used experimentally in their urology and nephrology departments. the tetrasys company that provided the medical record was able to incorporate their runtime without modifications, and typical mlm execution time was less than 1 sec.\n",

      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "in this paper, sams, a novel health information system architecture for developing intelligent health information systems is proposed and also some strategies for developing such systems are discussed. the systems fulfilling this architecture will be able to store electronic health records of the patients using owl ontologies, share patient records among different hospitals and provide physicians expertise to assist them in making decisions. the system is intelligent because it is rule-based, makes use of rule-based reasoning and has the ability to learn and evolve itself. the learning capability is provided by extracting rules from previously given decisions by the physicians and then adding the extracted rules to the system. the proposed system is novel and original in all of these aspects. as a case study, a system is implemented conforming to sams architecture for use by dentists in the dental domain. the use of the developed system is described with a scenario. for evaluation, the developed dental information system will be used and tried by a group of dentists. the development of this system proves the applicability of sams architecture. by getting decision support from a system derived from this architecture, the cognitive gap between experienced and inexperienced physicians can be compensated. thus, patient satisfaction can be achieved, inexperienced physicians are supported in decision making and the personnel can improve their knowledge. a physician can diagnose a case, which he/she has never diagnosed before, using this system. with the help of this system, it will be possible to store general domain knowledge in this system and the personnel's need to medical guideline documents will be reduced.\n",

      "clinical management of comorbidities is a challenge, especially in a clinical decision support setting, as it requires the safe and efficient reconciliation of multiple disease-specific clinical procedures to formulate a comorbid therapeutic plan that is both effective and safe for the patient. in this paper we pursue the integration of multiple disease-specific clinical practice guidelines (cpg) in order to manage co-morbidities within a computerized clinical decision support system (cdss). we present a cpg integration framework-termed as comet (comorbidity ontological modeling & execution) that manifests a knowledge management approach to model, computerize and integrate multiple cpg to yield a comorbid cpg knowledge model that upon execution can provide evidence-based recommendations for handling comorbid patients. comet exploits semantic web technologies to achieve (a) cpg knowledge synthesis to translate a paper-based cpg to disease-specific clinical pathways (cp) that include specialized co-morbidity management procedures based on input from domain experts; (b) cpg knowledge modeling to computerize the disease-specific cp using a comorbidity cpg ontology; (c) cpg knowledge integration by aligning multiple ontologically-modeled cp to develop a unified comorbid cpg knowledge model; and (e) cpg knowledge execution using reasoning engines to derive cpg-mediated recommendations for managing patients with comorbidities. we present a web-accessible comet cdss that provides family physicians with cpg-mediated comorbidity decision support to manage atrial fibrillation and chronic heart failure. we present our qualitative and quantitative analysis of the knowledge content and usability of comet cdss.\n",
